The nanomechanical simulations are done on realistic models of gold electrode tips bridged by a single dithioazobenzene molecule. Comparison of different tip models shows that the nature of the tips affects switching processes both qualitatively and quantitatively. The study predicts that purely photochemical cis ⇌ trans switching cycles of suspended azobenzene bridges are mechanically hindered; combined opto-mechanical as well as purely mechanochemical forward and backward switching is{,} however{,} feasible."

Molecular geometry, hyperpolarizability βFF and ground state dipole moment μg were acquired by RHF ab initio (6–31G∗∗) calculations using HyperChem software package. To characterize NLO performance of synthesized azo compounds second order non linear coefficients d31 and d33 were measured as function of chromophore load in guest–host films (PMMA). Eight synthesized compounds can be grouped in four similar gross formula pairs (different position of octyloxy group) with almost equal μg βFF product and different μg values. At low chromophore concentrations higher dipole moment compounds perform better. Lower dipole moment compounds have better NLO efficiency at high chromophore loads. Accurate ranking of all chromophores, based on two-level model corrected zero frequency d33(0) values, was not viable due to overestimation of the dispersion factor.}

The molecular structure gives rise to discrete exciton localization, allowing the formation of a highly photoactive antenna with a discrete energetic funnel. Steady state and fluorescence lifetime measurements have shown rapid and efficient exciton trapping at the molecular locus. Unique geometric and energetic attributes are observed which provide a means of protection from photobleaching, enhancing the longevity of these molecules. In addition, unexpected wavelength-dependent excimer formations are seen, suggesting unusual excitation-induced intermolecular interactions and dimer formations in more than one single excited state.}

Advancing the synthetic{,} spectroscopic and structural insights of these heterobimetallic systems{,} here we report a new family of alkyne supported alkali-metal nickelates of the formula Li4(solv)n(Ar)4Ni2{μ2:η2{,}η2-Ph–CC–Ph} (where solv = Et2O{,} THF; Ar = Ph{,} o-Tol{,} naphthyl{,} 4-tBu-C6H4) which can be accessed through the combination of Ni(COD)2{,} Ph–CC–Ph and the relevant lithium aryl in a 2 : 1 : 4 ratio. Demonstrating the versatility of this approach{,} the sodium and potassium nickelates can also be accessed when using PhNa or via alkali-metal exchange with AMOtBu (AM = Na{,} K). When employing bulky or structurally constrained aryl-lithiums{,} mononickel complexes of the formula Li2(solv)n(Ar)2Ni{η2-Ph–CC–Ph} are instead obtained{,} highlighting the structural diversity of alkali-metal nickelates bearing alkyne ligands. Expanding the catalytic potential of these systems{,} their ability to promote the catalytic cyclotrimerisation of diphenylacetylene to hexaphenylbenzene was explored{,} with mononickel compounds bearing electron rich aryl-substituents displaying the best performance."}

The CAM-B3LYP functional comprises of 0.19 Hartree–Fock (HF) plus 0.81 Becke 1988 (B88) exchange interaction at short-range, and 0.65 HF plus 0.35 B88 at long-range.

In this set, described as 4–31 G, each inner shell is represented by a single basis function taken as a sum of four Gaussians and each valence orbital is split into inner and outer parts described by three and one Gaussian function, respectively. The expansion coefficients and Gaussian exponents are determined by minimizing the total calculated energy of the atomic ground state. This basis set is then used in single‐determinant molecular‐orbital studies of a group of small polyatomic molecules. Optimization of valence‐shell scaling factors shows that considerable rescaling of atomic functions occurs in molecules, the largest effects being observed for hydrogen and carbon. However, the range of optimum scale factors for each atom is small enough to allow the selection of a standard molecular set. The use of this standard basis gives theoretical equilibrium geometries in reasonable agreement with experiment.}",

abstract  ="Gaussian basis sets of quadruple zeta valence quality for Rb–Rn are presented{,} as well as bases of split valence and triple zeta valence quality for H–Rn. The latter were obtained by (partly) modifying bases developed previously. A large set of more than 300 molecules representing (nearly) all elements—except lanthanides—in their common oxidation states was used to assess the quality of the bases all across the periodic table. Quantities investigated were atomization energies{,} dipole moments and structure parameters for Hartree–Fock{,} density functional theory and correlated methods{,} for which we had chosen Møller–Plesset perturbation theory as an example. Finally recommendations are given which type of basis set is used best for a certain level of theory and a desired quality of results."}

abstract = {Abstract The conductor-like solvation model, as developed in the framework of the polarizable continuum model (PCM), has been reformulated and newly implemented in order to compute energies, geometric structures, harmonic frequencies, and electronic properties in solution for any chemical system that can be studied in vacuo. Particular attention is devoted to large systems requiring suitable iterative algorithms to compute the solvation charges: the fast multipole method (FMM) has been extensively used to ensure a linear scaling of the computational times with the size of the solute. A number of test applications are presented to evaluate the performances of the method. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 24: 669–681, 2003},

abstract  ="It has become common to reference “pi-stacking” forces or “pi–pi interactions” when describing the interactions between neighbouring aromatic rings. Here{,} we review experimental and theoretical literature across several fields and conclude that the terms “pi-stacking” and “pi–pi interactions” do not accurately describe the forces that drive association between aromatic molecules of the types most commonly studied in chemistry or biology laboratories. We therefore propose that these terms are misleading and should no longer be used. Even without these terms{,} electrostatic considerations relating to polarized pi systems{,} as described by Hunter and Sanders{,} have provided a good qualitative starting place for predicting and understanding the interactions between aromatics for almost two decades. More recent work{,} however{,} is revealing that direct electrostatic interactions between polarized atoms of substituents as well as solvation/desolvation effects in strongly interacting solvents must also be considered and even dominate in many circumstances."}

abstract  ="The nature of π–π interactions has long been debated. The term “π-stacking” is considered by some to be a misnomer{,} in part because overlapping π-electron densities are thought to incur steric repulsion{,} and the physical origins of the widely-encountered “slip-stacked” motif have variously been attributed to either sterics or electrostatics{,} in competition with dispersion. Here{,} we use quantum-mechanical energy decomposition analysis to investigate π–π interactions in supramolecular complexes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons{,} ranging in size up to realistic models of graphene{,} and for comparison we perform the same analysis on stacked complexes of polycyclic saturated hydrocarbons{,} which are cyclohexane-based analogues of graphane. Our results help to explain the short-range structure of liquid hydrocarbons that is inferred from neutron scattering{,} trends in melting-point data{,} the interlayer separation of graphene sheets{,} and finally band gaps and observation of molecular plasmons in graphene nanoribbons. Analysis of intermolecular forces demonstrates that aromatic π–π interactions constitute a unique and fundamentally quantum-mechanical form of non-bonded interaction. Not only do stacked π–π architectures enhance dispersion{,} but quadrupolar electrostatic interactions that may be repulsive at long range are rendered attractive at the intermolecular distances that characterize π-stacking{,} as a result of charge penetration effects. The planar geometries of aromatic sp2 carbon networks lead to attractive interactions that are “served up on a molecular pizza peel”{,} and adoption of slip-stacked geometries minimizes steric (rather than electrostatic) repulsion. The slip-stacked motif therefore emerges not as a defect induced by electrostatic repulsion but rather as a natural outcome of a conformational landscape that is dominated by van der Waals interactions (dispersion plus Pauli repulsion){,} and is therefore fundamentally quantum-mechanical in its origins. This reinterpretation of the forces responsible for π-stacking has important implications for the manner in which non-bonded interactions are modeled using classical force fields{,} and for rationalizing the prevalence of the slip-stacked π–π motif in protein crystal structures."}

The dephasing times were determined by comparing the pulse duration dependent resonant enhancement of the total two pulse four wave mixing signal to a numerically evaluated theory. Data was taken with 80 and 400 fs transform limited pulses at 300 nm, the electronic origin of DPA in the two solvents. In DPA/2MP, T2=120 fs and in DPA/cyclohexane, T2=500 fs. The analysis required concentration and power dependent measurements to quantitatively determine the resonant enhancement of the signal arising from the addition of DPA to the solvents above the nonresonant solvent only signal. Fundamental experimental difficulties inherent in performing UV femtosecond two pulse photon echoes, in particular the competition with nonresonant signal, are discussed. An efficient numerical algorithm for calculating photon echo decay curves with realistic pulse envelope is described.}",
